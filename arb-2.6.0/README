Arb is a C library for high-performance arbitrary-precision floating-point ball
(mid-rad interval) arithmetic. It supports complex numbers, polynomials,
matrices, and evaluation of special functions, all with rigorous error
bounding.

Arb depends on FLINT (http://flintlib.org/), MPIR (http://mpir.org)
and MPFR (http://mpfr.org). It can be built as a standalone library,
or as part of FLINT as an optional extension package.

The build scripts are copied from FLINT and were written by Bill Hart.
